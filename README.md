# CalendarAndCustomerSQLDatabase

This project's main point is showing database connectivity to a MySQL database. The database contains a customer database
and an employee database. The user can schedule appointments with customers. Java was the programming language used.

Interesting Features
1. The login screen finds the user's locale and displays the login screen in either German or English

2. For scheduling appointments, the program determines the user's location and will always adjust the times
shown to their time zone, anywhere in the world.

3. The program can generate reports about various statistics of customers and employees.

4. The program generates a user log to show which users logged in at what times

5. The program uses a GUI, but the GUI is not the main point. It is simply there for the functionality
of the program. It is not an especially attractive GUI, but shows that a GUI can be done and integrated
with all of the features present in the program.
